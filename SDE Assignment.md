🚀 ReachInbox Hiring Assignment – Full-stack Email Job Scheduler
🎯 Problem Statement
At ReachInbox, a huge part of our system is reliable scheduling and sending of emails at scale.
Your task is to build a production-grade email scheduler service + dashboard that:
Accepts email send requests via APIs
Schedules them to be sent at a specific time
Uses BullMQ + Redis as a persistent job scheduler (no cron jobs)
Sends emails using fake SMTP via Ethereal Email
Survives server restarts without restarting from scratch or losing jobs
Exposes a frontend dashboard to:
Schedule new emails
View scheduled emails
View sent emails
Think of it as a tiny slice of what ReachInbox does under the hood.
🧪 Tech Requirements
You must use:
Backend
Language: TypeScript
Framework: Express.js
Queue: BullMQ (backed by Redis)
Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL (ORM or query builder is your choice)
SMTP: Ethereal Email (fake SMTP for testing)
Frontend
React.js or Next.js
Tailwind CSS (or any modern CSS library)
TypeScript strongly preferred
Infra
Redis and DB can be run via Docker (recommended but not mandatory)
We care about how you structure a real backend, wire queues correctly, and build a clean frontend.
🖥 Backend Requirements
1️⃣ Core Scheduler Behavior
Your backend must:
Accept email scheduling requests via API
Store them in a relational DB (MySQL/Postgres)
Schedule them using BullMQ delayed jobs (or a custom Redis/DB-based scheduler) – no cron
Send emails from multiple senders via Ethereal Email (SMTP)
Persist state so that:
If the server restarts, future emails are still sent at the correct time
Emails are not duplicated or restarted from scratch
2️⃣ Throughput, Rate Limiting & Concurrency (Required)
Your scheduler should behave like a real-world email system under load.
You must support:
✅ Worker Concurrency
Configure your BullMQ worker(s) with a configurable concurrency level .
Implementation must be safe when multiple jobs run in parallel:
✅ Delay Between Each Email
There must be a minimum delay between individual email sends (to mimic provider throttling).
You can:
Use BullMQ’s limiter options, or
Add a custom delay in the worker logic.
Document in the README what delay you chose (e.g. “min 2 seconds between sends”).
✅ Emails Per Hour (Rate Limiting)
Implement a rate limit on the number of emails sent per hour:
Either global (e.g. MAX_EMAILS_PER_HOUR=200
), or
Per-sender / per-tenant (e.g. MAX_EMAILS_PER_HOUR_PER_SENDER
), you will have to support multiple senders.
The limit values must be configurable via env/config (no hardcoding).
Rate-limiting logic must be safe across multiple workers / instances:
Use Redis or DB backed counters (e.g. keyed by hour_window + sender
),
Do not rely only on in-memory counts.
When the hourly limit is reached:
Do not drop or permanently fail jobs.
Jobs should be delayed / rescheduled into the next available hour window while preserving order as much as possible.
Explain in the README how you enforce this:
e.g. BullMQ limiter, Redis counters, custom logic, trade-offs, etc.
✅ Behavior Under Load
Your design should clearly define behavior when:
1000+ emails are scheduled for roughly the same time.
The rate limit would be exceeded.
You don’t need to actually send thousands via Ethereal, but your logic should handle it.
3️⃣ Hard Constraints (Important)
These are non-negotiable:
❌ Do NOT use cron jobs
No OS-level cron (crontab
, etc.)
No Node cron libraries (node-cron
, agenda
, etc.)
✅ Scheduling must be done using:
BullMQ delayed jobs, or
A custom scheduler that uses Redis/DB to track next run times — but still not cron.
✅ The system must be persistent:
After a restart:
Future scheduled emails still send at the right time
Emails are not re-sent or restarted from Day 1
❌ Same email queues should not be sent more than once. Maintain idempotency.
🎨 Frontend Requirements
You will build a frontend that matches the provided Figma as closely as possible and talks to your backend APIs.
Figma Link
1️⃣ Google Login (Required)
Implement real Google OAuth login (no mock).
After login, redirect the user to the dashboard.
Show in the top header:
User’s name
Email
Avatar
Provide a simple Logout option.
2️⃣ Main Dashboard
After login, show the main UI with:
Top header (user info + logout).
Tabs/sections:
Scheduled Emails
Sent Emails
A primary “Compose New Email” button.
Layout and styling should closely follow the Figma design.
3️⃣ Compose New Email
User must be able to:
Enter:
Subject
Body
Upload a CSV/text file of email leads.
Parse and show the number of email addresses detected.
Set:
Start time (when scheduling begins)
Delay between emails
Hourly limit
Click Schedule to send data to the backend schedule API.
This can be a modal or separate page, depending on the Figma.
4️⃣ Scheduled Emails
Show a clean table/list with:
Email
Subject
Scheduled time
Status
Include:
Loading states
Empty state when there are no scheduled emails
5️⃣ Sent Emails
Show a table/list with:
Email
Subject
Sent time
Status (sent
/ failed
)
Include:
Loading states
Empty state when there are no sent emails
6️⃣ Frontend Code Quality
We expect:
Clean folder structure
Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, tables, modals, etc.)
DRY code (avoid duplication)
Proper TypeScript usage:
Types/interfaces for API responses & props
Good UX:
Loading indicators
Empty states
Error handling (basic messages/toasts)
📦 Submission Guidelines
Create a private GitHub repository (monorepo or separate folders for backend & frontend is fine).
Grant access to user: Mitrajit and Yadav036
Add a README that includes:
How to run backend (Express, Redis, DB, BullMQ worker)
How to run frontend
How to set up Ethereal Email and env variables
Architecture overview:
How scheduling works
How persistence on restart is handled
How rate limiting & concurrency are implemented
List of features implemented, mapped to:
Backend: scheduler, persistence, rate limiting, concurrency
Frontend: login, dashboard, compose, tables, etc.
Add a short demo video (max 5 minutes):
Show creating scheduled emails (from frontend or Postman)
Show the dashboard with Scheduled and Sent emails
Show a restart scenario:
Stop server → start again → future emails still send
(Bonus) Briefly demonstrate how rate limiting / delay behaves under load
Note any assumptions, shortcuts, or trade-offs you made.
